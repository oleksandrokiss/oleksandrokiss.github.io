    <p>“<b>Protest is when I say I don’t like this and that.</b>
        <i>Resistance is when I see to it that things that I don’t like no longer occur.</i>
        <s>Protest is when I say I will no longer go along with it.</s>
        <u> Resistance is when I see to it that no one else goes along with it anymore either.” </u> </p>
    <p align="right">The class position can only be the class movement within the class war,
        the world proletariat engaged in armed struggle, the true vanguard, the liberation movements.</p>
    <p align="center">Certainly, there is also something heroic about it.
        However, we’re not concerned with that. We are, instead, concerned with its consequences.</p>
    <p align="justify">But that’s enough. I have the impression that I’m talking to a wall,
        and that is not the point of all of this. The goal is to have you climb down from your pedestal.</p>
